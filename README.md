# weatherApp
# **Problem Statement**

You are building a weather app for a company. The app will display the current weather for a given location and provide a 5-day forecast. The app should be able to retrieve the data from an open source weather API and display it in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner.

# **Requirements**

1. The app should retrieve the current weather information for a given location and display it to the user.
2. The app should retrieve the 5-day forecast for the given location and display it to the user.
3. The app should have a user-friendly interface that clearly displays the weather information.
4. The app should be able to handle errors and display a meaningful message to the user in case of any errors retrieving data from the API.

# **Technical Requirements**

1. You can use either Flutter or React-Native for this exercise.
2. You should use an open source weather API to retrieve the data. Some popular options include OpenWeatherMap, Weather Underground, and AccuWeather.
3. You should submit the code for the project as repository on a platform like GitHub.

# **Evaluation Criteria**

1. Correctness: Does the app retrieve the weather information as required and display it in a user-friendly manner?
2. Code quality: Is the code readable, maintainable, and well-structured?
    1. How did you architect the frontend? How did you break down components? Were things made in a reusable and modular way?
    2. Did we use any design patterns for this? If so, what did we use?
3. User experience: Is the app visually appealing and easy to use? Do you bring good intuition as an engineer on solid UI/UX practices?
4. Error handling: Does the app handle errors gracefully and display meaningful error messages to the user?
5. Is the application build in a way which is production ready?
6. Documentation: You're able to use any libraries or frameworks you wish, but be prepared to explain what you used and why you made this decision in your README.md
